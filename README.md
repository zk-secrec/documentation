# ZK-SecreC Compiler, Language and Standard Library Documentation

This documentation can be served using the `mkdocs` utility. It has been tested with version 1.6.0. As during the development, another server, Pandora, was used for serving the documentation, some details may be displayed suboptimally with `mkdocs`.

We have uploaded the `site` directory and its contents along with the source files, so the user can in principle open the documentation HTML files directly with a web browser.
